# Neoware CA2 - Splash Free BIOS
This is a BIOS file for Neoware CA2 without that annoying splash screen.

Simply burn CA2_BIOS_NO_SPLASH.BIN to a SST39SF020A @PLCC32, carefully remove your stock BIOS and place the new one in. That's all!

You can also overwrite your stock BIOS, but be sure to back it up before flashing!

This BIOS file was extracted from a Neoware CA2 BA-EON4300S-2E, so please check if this is compatible with your Neoware CA2 revision.
